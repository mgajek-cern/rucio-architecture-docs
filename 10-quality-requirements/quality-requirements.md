# Measurable Quality Requirements & Performance Tests

*To be defined with stakeholders, example below*

## Scale Requirements

Metric: Manage ≥1 exabyte total data volume, ≥1 billion files, ≥25 million containers
Test: Load test with simulated datasets reaching target volumes, measure catalog performance degradation

## Geographic Distribution

Metric: Support ≥100 geographically distributed sites across ≥3 continents
Test: Multi-site deployment test with latency measurements between regions, failover testing

## High Availability

Metric: System remains operational with ≤2 minutes downtime during single component failure
Test: Chaos engineering tests (kill pods, disconnect databases), measure recovery time and data consistency

## Transfer Rates

Metric: Aggregate transfer rate ≥40 GB/s across all active transfers
Test: Concurrent large file transfers between multiple sites, monitor sustained throughput over 1+ hours

## API Response Time

Metric: 95th percentile response time <50ms for catalog queries under normal load
Test: Load testing with increasing concurrent requests, measure response time percentiles

## Availability

Metric: 99.9% uptime (≤8.77 hours downtime per year)
Test: Long-running availability monitoring over 6+ months, automated health checks every 30 seconds

## Concurrent Users

Metric: Support ≥1000 simultaneous authenticated API connections without performance degradation
Test: Concurrent user simulation with realistic workload patterns, measure throughput and error rates
