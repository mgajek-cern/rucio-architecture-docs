# architecture-docs

## Summary

This repository contains unofficial documentation of the Rucio architecture.
Its primary goal is to provide a minimal and focused understanding of the system (building blocks, communication between components and systems, relevant cross-cutting concepts, etc.). It is intended as a lightweight reference to support personal comprehension and quick lookup, rather than as a comprehensive or authoritative source.
